      <li>12 lasagna noodles uncooked</li>
      <li>4 cups shredded mozzarella cheese divided</li>
      <li>1/2 cup shredded Parmesan cheese shredded and divided</li>
      <li>3/4 teaspoon salt more to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Tomato Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>1/2 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 pound Italian sausage</li>
      <li>1 yellow onion diced</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>36 ounces pasta sauce</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cheese Mixture</h4>
      <li>2 cups ricotta cheese or cottage cheese</li>
      <li>1/4 cup fresh parsley, chopped</li>
      <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Bring a large pot
        of salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles
        and cook until al dente (firm) according to package
        directions. Drain, rinse under cold water, and set
        aside.</li> 
      <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet or Dutch oven, brown
        the beef, sausage, onion, and garlic over medium-high
        heat until no pink remains. Drain any fat.</li>
      <li>Stir in the pasta sauce, tomato paste, Italian
        seasoning, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of
        black pepper. Simmer uncovered over medium heat for 5
        minutes or until slightly thickened. Taste and season
        with additional salt if desired.</li>
      <li>In a separate medium bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups
        mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup parmesan cheese, ricotta,
        parsley, egg, and 1/4 teaspoon salt.</li>
      <li>Spread 1 cup of the meat sauce in a 9x13 pan or
        casserole dish. Top it with 3 lasagna noodles. Layer
        with 1/3 of the ricotta cheese mixture and 1 cup meat
        sauce. Repeat twice more. Finish with 3 noodles topped
        with remaining sauce.</li>
      <li>Cover with foil and bake for 45 minutes</li>  
      <li>Rest for at least 15 minutes before cutting</li>

    </ol>
